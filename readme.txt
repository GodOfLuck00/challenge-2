This html is my professional portfolio filled with the work I complete in this bootcamp.
I have had serious struggles with CSS and all of this will be redone by the time the bootcamp is over.
This portfolio is currently very embarassing.
I need serious help setting up nested flexboxes because the lessons' code does not seem to apply to anything but runbuddy.
